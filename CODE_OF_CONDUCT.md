# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

- Demonstrating respect and kindness to others  
- Being considerate in speech and actions  
- Showing empathy towards different viewpoints and experiences  
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback  
- Focusing on what is best for the community

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances  
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks  
- Public or private harassment  
- Publishing othersâ€™ private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission  
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that violates this Code of Conduct.

## Reporting

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project maintainers at **adityaax@proton.me**

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

## Enforcement

Participants asked to stop any unacceptable behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in unacceptable behavior, the project maintainers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the community.
