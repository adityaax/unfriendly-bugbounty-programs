### Summary of the Incident

A valid HTML injection vulnerability was reported to fyers.in on 19 Nov 2024. The bug was patched without any communication of a reward. Despite the program listing ₹10,000 for a P4 severity, the report was downgraded as informational/NA without clear justification.

**The company claimed:**

*The risk remains localized to the user's own browser session.*

However, this is misleading, as the payload could be reflected in any user's browser, not just the attacker's. This **contradicts** the company's own program scope, where HTML injection is not listed as out-of-scope.
