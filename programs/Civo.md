### Summary of the Incident

A total of 8 valid vulnerabilities were reported to Civo starting on 6 April 2024. Despite submitting all reports in good faith, the researcher has only received automated acknowledgment emails and has not received any follow-up or validation to date.

Interestingly, the company later updated its Bug Bounty Policy, stating that low-severity issues must now be reviewed within 15 days. However, the older pending reports remain unreviewed, some of which have been waiting for over a **year**.

This lack of response undermines trust in the program and discourages responsible disclosure.
