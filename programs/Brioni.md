### Summary of the Incident

On May 3, 2025, mrknight-nidu discovered an HTML injection vulnerability in the search parameter of Brioni’s main domain (brioni.com). By chaining it with an XSS payload (<a href="javascript:alert('PoC by mrknight-nidu');alert(document.cookie)">Click</a>), He confirmed a working XSS vulnerability. He submitted a detailed proof-of-concept (PoC) through Brioni’s VDP form.
